# Heatwave-related_PTBs_assessment
Updated R code and data for original research "Heatwave exposure and preterm birth in China: attributable disease burden and human capital consequences"

######################################################################################################################################################
A methodologic framework to estimate the heatwave-related preterm births(PTBs) of China in the actual climate and from anthropogenic climate change based on the simulated scenarios.  

future health impacts under climate change scenarios based on a defined set of assumptions and advanced statistical techniques developed in time-series analysis in environmental epidemiology. The main methodological steps and essential elements are listed as following:

1. _01-Heatwave days in actual climate.R_, _02-days with pre1week heatwave experience.R_,_03-Calibration and identification in simulated scenarios(file folder)_
