# Heatwave-related_PTBs_assessment
Updated R code and data for original research "Heatwave exposure and preterm birth in China: attributable disease burden and human capital consequences"

###################################################################################################

A methodologic framework to estimate the heatwave-related preterm births(PTBs) of China in the actual climate and from anthropogenic climate change based on the simulated scenarios.The main methodological steps and essential elements are listed as following:

Files in the "code" folder
1. _01-Heatwave days in actual climate.R_, _02-days with pre1week heatwave experience.R_,_03-Calibration and identification in simulated scenarios(file folder)_ and _04-map 42year heatwave days.R_ perform the second step in the published article.
2. _05-Heatwave-related PTBs in the actual climate.R_,_06-heatwave-related PTBs in simualted scenarios.R_ perform the third step in the article. The picture in this step is similar to that in the first step(refer to _04-map 42year heatwave days.R_), so we do not provide addtional code.
3. _07- Human capital consequence estimates.R_ performs the last step of the article.

Raw data are all stored in the "data" folder. 
The description and usage of these data have been detailed introduced at the top of corresponding R script list above.
