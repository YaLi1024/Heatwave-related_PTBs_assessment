# Heatwave-related_PTBs_assessment
Updated R code and data for original research "Heatwave exposure and preterm birth in China: attributable disease burden and human capital consequences"

###################################################################################################

A methodologic framework to estimate the heatwave-related preterm births(PTBs) of China in the actual climate and from anthropogenic climate change.The key methodological steps and essential elements are listed as following:

Files in the "code" folder
1. _01-Calibration and identification in simulated scenarios(file folder)_ perform the calibration for the simulated temperatures, identify heatwaves for each scenario model and calculate the heatwave days for factual and counterfactual scenarios.
2. _02-Heatwave-related PTBs in the actual climate.R_ calculate heatwave-attributable PTBs of china during 2010-2020 in actual cliamte.
3. _03-heatwave-related PTBs in simualted scenarios.R_ evaluate the heatwave-related PTBs in the factual and counterfactual scenarios and those caused by anthropogenic climate change.
4. _04- Human capital consequence estimates.R_ calculate human capital consequences of attributable PTBs in the actual climate and those caused by anthropogenic climate change.

The description and usage of these data have been detailed introduced at the top of corresponding R script listed above.
Key data sources have been listed in _Data avaliability_ of the research article. Other suport data are uploaded here as well.
