# 05.CALCULATION OF HEATWAVE-ATTRIBUTABLE PTBS IN WARM SEASONS DURING 2010-2020
#      OF CHINA IN THE ACTUAL CLIAMTE.
########################################################################################
# We first estimate the baseline preterm birth (PTB) number for each day during 
#     2010-2020 for each grid in China.
# By identifying if there was at least a heatwave between day(t-6) to day(t) 
#     for each day(t), we can know if premature infants in day (t) whose mother 
#     have experienced heatwaves in their last gestational week.
# If mothers have experienced heatwave in their last gestational week (day (t-6) - day t),
#     then a part of baseline PTBs on the day(t) can be attributed to heatwaves.
#     This proportion is the attributable fraction and computed as ((RR-1))/RR. 
# 
# LOAD REVELANT DATA
#  -global_demographics_1950_2020.nc, providing global gridded population number. 
#  -grid_HWdays_May.csv,providing the longitude and latitude for grids of China.
#  -1979-2020nation_birth_rate.xlsx,providing provincial birth rates in China.
#  -nation_preterm_rate.csv, estimated by findings of previous studies and providing
#     the provincial PTB rates in China during 2010-2020.
#  -birth propotion by month.xlsx, providing the proportion of living birth in each 
#     month to that in a year.
#  -point estimate of RR, relative risk of PTB due to the exposure of heatwaves in the
#     last gestational week, obtained from the work (under review) of our research team.
